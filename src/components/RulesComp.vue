            <li> The referee shall verify the identity of the players and coaches with his/her player pass. He shall
                collect
                the passes of those players and coaches who are to participate in the game. The referee must allow no
                player
                into the game for whom he/she has no pass.</li>
            <li>Upon completion of the game, the referee shall send his/her report to the UYSA offices within four (4)
                days,

            <li>A referee report form must be filed for every game played.</li>

                their certification level and registration standing with the USSF to coach, assistant coach, or team
                captain
                of teams participating in that game. Prior to the game a coach may decide to postpone the game if the
                referees do not produce the requested documentation. The game is to be replayed at a later date.</li>
            <li>Referees not complying with this section will be referred to the Disciplinary Committee.</li>
